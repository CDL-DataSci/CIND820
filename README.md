# CIND820 - Big Data Analytics Project
TMU CIND820 Capstone Project - Parliament of Canada Hansard Debate Records (2006 - 2023)

This project is aims to explore what information can be gained through applying text mining and topic modeling approaches to the historical Hansard debate records from the Parliament of Canada. The identified dataset covers from 2006 to 2023 (39-1 Parliment to part of 44-1). The data set includes 1972 pdf files in total and collectively represent 155,385 pages.

The literature review of past research has highlighted the importance of a using a systematic approach to text mining techniques, the benefits of leveraging a combined topic model from LDA and TF-IDF, as well as considerations for evaluation of topic models and the validation of the labels for the extract topic. The literature review also helped to identify comparable alternatives to LDA that include HDP and the more recent BERTopic. While the literature review has identified possible advantages for these alternative topic models, there is a potential for these alternatives to be more computationally intensive and the performance of these different modeal will be explored in the final report.
